# check_leap_year
Python program to check weather a year is leap year or not.
--Leap year is that year in which we have 366 days.
Usually we have 365 days in a year. And so, if you need to identify whether the year is leap year or not, simply divide the year
with 4 and if the remainder is 0 then it is a leap year.

Algorithm

The following pseudocode determines whether a year is a leap year or a common year.

step1- if (year is not divisible by 4) then (it is a common year)
step2- else if (year is not divisible by 100) then (it is a leap year)
step3- else if (year is not divisible by 400) then (it is a common year)
